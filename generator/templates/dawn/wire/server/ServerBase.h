        //   2) It allows us to use |mKnown| when we know we can access it without the lock.
        // To clarify the threading model of the KnownObjects, there is always a "main" thread on
        // the server which is responsible for flushing commands from the client. This thread is
        // the only thread that ever calls |HandleCommandsImpl| which ultimately calls into the
        // command handlers in the generated ServerHandlers.cpp. All other threads that can
        // interact with |mKnown| are async or spontaneous callback threads which always hold the
        // lock for the full duration of their call, see |ForwardToServerHelper| where we force all
        // callbacks to take the lock. On the "main" thread, we only acquire the lock whenever we
        // |Allocate| or |Free|. We need to lock w.r.t other threads for |Allocate| because
        // internally, that can cause a |std::vector::push_back| call which may invalidate all
        // pointers. As a result, we cannot have another thread doing anything during that window.
        // Similarly, for |Free|, we may release the WGPU* backing handle which is also not allowed
        // to race. Reads on the "main" thread are not explicitly synchronized because callbacks
        // are not allowed to allocate or free objects which guarantees that the reads on the
        // "main" thread will be pointer stable. Furthermore, it is actually necessary that we
        // don't hold the lock for reads on the "main" thread because APIs like |Device::Destroy|
        // can cause us to wait on callbacks which as stated above, require the lock to complete.
        // So if we were to hold the lock on the "main" thread during the read and execution of
        // |Device::Destroy|, we could deadlock when we try waiting for callbacks which can't
        // acquire this lock.
        // TODO(https://crbug.com/412761856): Revisit this logic and consider using a rw-lock
        // in conjunction with taking additional refs to "special" objects/function pairs that can
        // cause callbacks to run when called. This would make this logic less specific to the way
        // that the Dawn tests and Chromium uses the wire.
